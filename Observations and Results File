# 📊 Observations and Results

## 1️⃣ Bit Error Rate (BER) Performance
- The **BER performance** of BPSK and QPSK was analyzed over an **AWGN channel**.
- **BPSK** showed better noise resilience compared to **QPSK**.
- **QPSK** achieved higher **spectral efficiency** but had a slightly **higher BER**.
- The **simulated BER** results closely matched **theoretical values**, confirming the simulation's accuracy.

## 2️⃣ Eye Diagrams 👁️
- **BPSK Eye Diagram:**
  - Single eye opening, indicating **minimal inter-symbol interference (ISI)**.
  - Clear symbol transitions, ensuring **reliable detection**.
- **QPSK Eye Diagram:**
  - Two eye openings due to **quadrature modulation**.
  - More complex transitions compared to BPSK but still interpretable.

## 3️⃣ Constellation Diagrams 🌟
- **BPSK Constellation:**
  - Two distinct points representing binary symbols (-1 and +1).
  - Clearly separated, showing **strong noise resilience**.
- **QPSK Constellation:**
  - Four constellation points representing different symbol pairs.
  - Slight spread due to **AWGN noise**, but points remained distinguishable.

## 4️⃣ BER vs. Eb/N0 Plot 📈
- The **BER curve** demonstrated an **exponential decline** as **Eb/N0** increased.
- **BPSK** required a lower **Eb/N0** to achieve a given **BER** compared to **QPSK**.
- The **theoretical and simulated BER curves** followed similar trends, validating the model.

## 5️⃣ Key Insights 💡
✅ **BPSK is more robust** to noise, ideal for **low-power and long-distance communications**.
✅ **QPSK offers higher data rates**, but requires a **higher SNR** for reliable communication.
✅ The results align with **theoretical expectations**, demonstrating the **trade-offs** between **spectral efficiency and noise immunity**.

## 🎯 Conclusion
This project successfully **simulated and analyzed** **BPSK and QPSK** in an **AWGN channel**. The results confirmed that while **BPSK is more noise-resilient, QPSK offers better bandwidth efficiency**. This simulation serves as a solid foundation for understanding **digital modulation techniques** in real-world applications.
